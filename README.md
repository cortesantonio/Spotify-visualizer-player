# Spotify API Integration Repository for Controlling Playback and Displaying Current Song (HTML and JS)

Welcome to the Spotify API integration repository! 
This project aims to provide a solution using HTML and JavaScript to control music playback and display the currently playing song using the Spotify API.

	Description
This repository contains the source code and necessary resources to create a web application that interacts with the Spotify API. The application allows you to authenticate with your Spotify account, control music playback, and obtain real-time information about the currently playing song.

	Key Features
User Authentication: The application guides you through the Spotify authentication process to obtain a valid access token and authorize access to your playback data.

Playback Control: Once authenticated, you can control music playback from the web interface. You can pause, resume, skip to the next song, and go back to the previous song.

Current Song Information Display: The application displays real-time information about the currently playing song, including the song title, artist name, and album image.

Song Search: In addition to playback control, the application also allows you to search for songs on Spotify and play them directly from the web interface.

	Technologies Used
The repository utilizes the following technologies:

HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and design of the web interface.
JavaScript for interacting with the Spotify API and controlling playback.
Spotify Web API to access playback data and search for songs.
